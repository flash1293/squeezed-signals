# Phase 6: Drop Order Preservation

Removes the order mapping from Phase 5 for maximum compression. Trade-off: 21% space savings vs. no exact chronological reconstruction.

## What Changes

**Phase 5 structure:**
```
- Reordered logs (grouped by template)
- Order mapping (2,300 bytes) ✅
- Can reconstruct original order ✅
```

**Phase 6 structure:**
```
- Reordered logs (grouped by template)
- Order mapping REMOVED ❌
- Cannot reconstruct original order ❌
- Timestamps still available for approximate ordering ⚠️
```

## Results

**HDFS small dataset:**
- Input: 13.1 KB (Phase 5 with order mapping)
- Output: 10.9 KB (no order mapping)
- Compression: **50.9x** (vs 1x baseline, +1.21x vs Phase 5)
- Bytes per line: 5.6 (down from 6.7)

**Space savings:**
```
Phase 5: 13,456 bytes = 11,156 (data) + 2,300 (order mapping)
Phase 6: 11,156 bytes = 11,156 (data) + 0 (no mapping)
Saved: 2,300 bytes (17.1% of Phase 5)
```

## What's Preserved

✅ All templates
✅ All variable values (including timestamps)
✅ Template assignments
✅ Lossless data (no information lost)
✅ Timestamp-based sorting possible

❌ Exact original chronological order

## Approximate Ordering

Logs can still be sorted by timestamp:
```
- Extract timestamps from variable columns
- Sort logs by timestamp
- Result: Approximate chronological order (accurate to timestamp precision)
- Good enough for most analysis/debugging
```

**Limitation:** If multiple logs share exact same timestamp, their relative order within that second is unknown.

## When to Use Phase 6

**Good for:**
- Long-term archival
- Cost optimization at scale (17% = significant)
- External indexing (Elasticsearch, Splunk maintain order)
- Timestamps provide sufficient ordering

**Avoid for:**
- Debugging requiring exact order
- Race condition analysis
- Regulatory requirements for perfect ordering
- Real-time streaming

## Cost Savings at Scale

```
1 PB logs:
  Phase 5: 1 PB / 42.2 = 23.7 TB
  Phase 6: 1 PB / 50.9 = 19.6 TB
  Savings: 4.1 TB (17.3%)

At $0.023/GB/month (AWS S3):
  Monthly savings: $94
  Annual savings: $1,128
```

At 100 PB scale: $112,800/year savings.

## Usage

```bash
python 06_drop_order_preservation.py --size small
```
