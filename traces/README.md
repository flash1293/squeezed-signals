# Traces: Distributed Execution Storage Evolution

ðŸ”„ **Status: Coming Soon**

This section will demonstrate the progressive optimization of distributed trace storage, showing how to compress complex nested structures while maintaining query performance.

## ðŸŽ¯ Planned Objectives

Distributed traces present unique compression challenges compared to metrics:

- **Complex hierarchical structures**: Parent-child span relationships
- **High-cardinality attributes**: Service names, operation names, custom tags
- **Variable data shapes**: Different services produce different span structures
- **Temporal correlations**: Spans from the same request occur in temporal clusters

## ðŸ“‹ Planned Evolution Phases

1. **JSON Baseline** - Standard OpenTelemetry JSON export format
2. **Protobuf Encoding** - Binary serialization with schema
3. **Attribute Deduplication** - Extract common tags to reference tables
4. **Span Relationship Compression** - Exploit parent-child structures
5. **Service Topology Optimization** - Graph-based compression
6. **Temporal Clustering** - Time-based batching for correlation
7. **Multi-resolution Storage** - Sampling strategies for long-term retention

## ðŸ”¬ Planned Research Areas

### Span Compression Techniques
- **Attribute extraction**: Common tag deduplication across spans
- **Temporal correlation**: Exploiting request timing patterns  
- **Service topology**: Graph-based compression using service relationships
- **Schema evolution**: Handling changing trace structures

### Distributed System Patterns
- **Request correlation**: Leveraging trace relationships for compression
- **Service boundaries**: Optimizing storage per service characteristics
- **Multi-tenant optimization**: Efficient storage across different services
- **Real-time vs batch**: Trade-offs between ingestion speed and compression

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Outcomes

- **Significant compression ratios** for trace data while preserving query capability
- **Demonstrate techniques** applicable to production trace storage systems
- **Educational examples** showing evolution from simple to sophisticated approaches
- **Performance analysis** of compression vs query trade-offs

## ðŸ“š Coming Soon

The traces implementation will include:

- Complete trace data generation with realistic distributed patterns
- Step-by-step compression evolution with detailed analysis
- Performance benchmarking and trade-off discussions
- Production-ready techniques suitable for adaptation
