  - Service-level summaries (aggregated spans per service)
  - Critical path traces (only spans on critical path)
  - Error-only traces (spans with errors + context)
  - Time-bucketed trace summaries
  - Cross-trace correlation patterns
- **Expected Compression**: 100-200x vs NDJSON (with lossy summaries)
